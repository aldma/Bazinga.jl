Bazinga.jl
=====

Bazinga.jl is a software package for large-scale, constrained, structured optimizatiom. It attempts to be a toolbox which offers robust, easy to use, yet efficient and fast numerical optimization algorithms. Indeed, it is a Numerical Optimization Toolbox.

It is designed to find (local) solutions of mathematical optimization problems of the form

```
   min     f(x) + g(x)
  x ∈ Rⁿ
   s.t.    c(x) ∈ S
```
where ```f(x): Rⁿ --> R``` is a smooth objective function, ```g(x): Rⁿ --> R ∪ ∞``` is a proximable objective function, ```c(x): Rⁿ --> Rᵐ``` are the constraint functions, and ```S ⊆ Rᵐ``` is a set which is easy to project onto.

Bazinga is written in pure [Julia](https://julialang.org/). The code has been written by [Alberto De Marchi](albertodm92@libero.it).
